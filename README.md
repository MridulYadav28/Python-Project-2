Project : Number Guessing Game in Python

Introduction

This code implements a simple number guessing game in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the correct number within a certain number of attempts.

Key Concepts

1. Random Number Generation: The code uses the random.randint() function to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. User Input: The program prompts the user to input their guess and provides feedback based on the guess.
3. Looping: The game continues in a loop until the user guesses the correct number.
4. Attempts Counter: The code keeps track of the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number.

Code Structure

The code consists of a single function guess_number() that encapsulates the entire game logic. It generates a random number, prompts the user for input, provides feedback, and keeps track of the number of attempts until the correct number is guessed.
